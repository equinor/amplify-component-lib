Amplify Component Library (ACL) contains components, utils, providers and hooks developed and used by the Amplify team. 

This package is first and foremost for our own Amplify applications. You can use them outside of Amplify if you want, but we will not be supporting any needs that don't align with our own Amplify applications. If you have an issue or find any bugs, create an issue in Github as we don't accept PRs from contributors outside of the Amplify team.

# Building amplify-component-lib

Build and publish is done automatically when code is merged into `main` branch, if the package.json version number is higher.

# Using config files from amplify-component-lib

1. Navigate to your projects root folder, `~/Projects/recap` for instance

2. Copy and run the following command

```bash
wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/equinor/amplify-component-lib/main/config/install.sh | bash
```

This should have downloaded the different config files to your project root folder.

If you want to ignore certain configuration files you can create a `.acl-ignore` file in the `client` folder in your project.

For example: `acquire/client/.acl-ignore`

```text
eslint.config.mjs
CODEOWNERS
pull_request.yaml
```

# Using github action workflows related to deploying from github from amplify-component-lib

1. Navigate to your projects root folder, `~/Projects/recap` for instance

2. Copy and run the following command

```bash
wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/equinor/amplify-component-lib/main/config/install-deployment-files.sh | bash
```

This should have downloaded the `build_deploy_radix.yaml`, `promote.yaml`, `notify.yaml`, `push.yaml`

NOTE: These files should eventually be served from the same install script we use for getting other config files. We serve it from a different script so that applications which are not ready for the change in deployment process don't have to rush.

## Notes

This script assumes the following structure in the project

```text
project
│   README.md
│
└───client
│   |   ...
│
└───server
    │   ...
```

# Using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)

## Download and install pre-commit

Using python's pip to download pre-commit

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

Using brew to download pre-commit

```bash
brew install pre-commit
```

finally install pre-commit

```bash
pre-commit
```

## Add config file, .pre-commit-config.yaml

Your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file should look something like below

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: hadolint
        name: Lint Dockerfiles
        description: Runs hadolint to lint Dockerfiles
        language: system
        types: ['dockerfile']
        entry: hadolint
      - id: trufflehog
        name: TruffleHog
        description: Detect secrets in your data with TruffleHog.
        entry: trufflehog git file://. --since-commit HEAD --only-verified --fail
        language: golang
        pass_filenames: false
      - id: prettier
        name: Prettier
        description: Runs prettier on supported files
        language: system
        entry: 'npx prettier --check'
        files: .*\.jsx?$|.*\.tsx?$|.*\.ts?$
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-eslint
    rev: v9.9.0
    hooks:
      - id: eslint
        files: \.[jt]sx?$ # *.js, *.jsx, *.ts and *.tsx
        types: [file]
        additional_dependencies:
          - eslint@8.57.0
          - eslint-config-prettier@9.1.0
          - eslint-plugin-prettier@5.1.3
          - eslint-plugin-react@7.34.0
          - eslint-plugin-react-hooks@4.6.0
          - eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort@12.0.0

```

## Install hooks

When you have your config file in place you need to install the hooks

```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Dockerfile linting

We use [hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) to check that our docker file is using best practice.

### Install

In order to commit changes related to a dockerfile you need to have hadolint installed

#### CLI

On OSX you can use [brew](https://brew.sh/) to install:

```bash
brew install hadolint
```

On Windows you can use [scoop](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop) to install:

```bash
scoop install hadolint
```

In any of these do not work then you can refer to the [installation section](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint?tab=readme-ov-file#install) in hadolint's repository

#### VS Code

If you want to shorten the feedback loop when changing your dockerfile you can optionally add the [hadolint extension](https://github.com/michaellzc/vscode-hadolint) (Extension id: `exiasr.hadolint`)

#### WebStorm

Looks like it is [not available](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IJPL-69780/Bundle-hadolint-a-Docker-linting-tool) for WebStorm at the moment
