## Amplify components Storybook

This is the storybook for the `@equinor/amplify-component-lib` npm-package.

In here you will find components that are used in the amplify team developed applications in Equinor.
Everything from small utilities we use, like `formatDate()` and bigger things like the `FieldSelector` component.

This project is maintained and developed by and for the amplify team.
