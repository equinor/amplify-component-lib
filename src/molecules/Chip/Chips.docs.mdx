## Usage

Chips allow users to enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger actions.

<ul>
  <li>Chips are **compact** components that represent discrete information.</li>
  <li>Chips should be **relevant** to the content or task they represent.</li>

  <li>
    Chips should make tasks easier to complete, or content easier to sort.
  </li>
</ul>

## Examples

### Read only Chip

**Read only is doesn't have its own prop, but is defined only when onClick AND onDelete is undefined (or not present in the props at all.)**

Read only chips are when chips only should display information, and not be interactive.
