# Icons

**Story from EDS**

<Links edsSBUrl="https://storybook.eds.equinor.com/?path=/docs/icons-preview--docs" />

Icons included in the EDS icon library.

Hover over an icon to download as svg or use the name for lookup in the `@equinor/eds-icons` package.

**Note:** in the npm-package, icons ending with \_small do not exist individually but are stored within the regular icon under `icon.sizes.small` and used automatically when Icon size is set to 16 or 18.
